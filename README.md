# chess
I independently developed a chess program on Java with three features: The Board, The Board Editor, and The Cool Board. The board is a classic chess game, where the user starts as white, clicks the desired piece and then the desired location. The user then switches to the black pieces and repeats. The Board Editor is similar to the board but the pieces can be customized to start from a situation that isn't the original setup and can begin play at any board situation. The Cool Board is similar to the Board tab but has a "Test" button, which runs through every scenario for each piece on the board in high speed, which looks very cool, hence its name. This program in its entirety took me approximately 60 hours of work and was a great challenge, but seeing the final product run the way I envisioned it was worth every minute.
